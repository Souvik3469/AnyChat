Chat from client to server and server responds back (bidirectional) socket connect with User authentcation and session storage using Strapi as the backend.


## Authors

- [@Souvik3469](https://github.com/Souvik3469)(Souvik Sen)

## Features
- I have used Strapi for the backend which provides me with their inbuilt user authentication endpoints.
- Used Web sockets (socket-io) to establish bidirectional messaging (realtime).
- Only authenticated users can message. (Used jwt provided by strapi and decoded it in the frontend to get user-details)
- Stored the jwt token in the local storage of the frontend to preserve sessions of the User unless he/she logs out or the token expires.
- Stored the chat sessions as well mapped with the correct userId such that respective users can view their chat history after refreshing or after again logging in.
